# Battleship Program Design and Methods

## Main Menu Interaction
1. **Display Main Menu**
   - Allow the user to choose:
     - Start a new game
     - Load a saved game
     - View game instructions
     - Quit the program

## Game Initialization
2. **Start a New Game**
   - Initialize an empty game board
   - Let the user set ship positions
   - Set AI ship positions
3. **Load a Game**
   - Read a saved game state from a file and initialize the game board

## During Gameplay
4. **Player's Turn**
   - Display the current game board
   - Prompt the user for coordinates to target
   - Validate user input
   - Process shot results (hit, miss, repeat shot, out of bounds)
   - Update the game board
   - Check if any ship has been sunk
   - Determine if the game is over
5. **AI's Turn**
   - AI selects a target (randomly or strategically based on difficulty)
   - Process shot results (hit, miss)
   - Update the game board
   - Check if any ship has been sunk
   - Determine if the game is over

## Game End
6. **Game Over**
   - Display the winner
   - Provide an option to return to the main menu

## Save and Load Game
7. **Save Game**
   - User chooses to save the game
   - Save the current game state to a file
8. **Load Game**
   - User chooses to load a game
   - Read from a file and restore the game state

## Method Breakdown
Based on the above, let's organize the program into the following methods:

1. `displayMainMenu()`
2. `displayInstructions()`
3. `startNewGame()`
4. `loadGame()`
5. `initializeBoard(char[][] board)`
6. `placePlayerShips(char[][] board)`
7. `placeAIShips(char[][] board)`
8. `displayGameBoard(char[][] playerBoard, char[][] aiBoard, boolean revealAI)`
9. `playerTurn()`
10. `aiTurn()`
11. `isValidInput(int row, int col)`
12. `processShot(char[][] board, int row, int col)`
13. `updateBoard(char[][] board, int row, int col, boolean hit)`
14. `isShipSunk(char[][] board, char shipType)`
15. `isGameOver(char[][] board)`
16. `saveGame(String filename)`
17. `loadGame(String filename)`
18. `displayGameOver(boolean playerWon)`
