/*
    CharToString.java: Declare a character variable (char ch). Read a 
    character into the variable ch and then store it in a String variable using the 
    valueOf method. Print out both the char and string value at the end to test 
    your program.
    (Note that the valueOf method is static... this means that the method can be 
    called without an instance of the class. Therefore you can say 
    String.valueOf, this is similar to how youâ€™ve used the random method in the 
    math class.
