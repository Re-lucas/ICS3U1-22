	Description:  The height of an object at any given time dropped from a starting 
    height of 100 meters is given by the equation h = 100 â€“ 4.9t2 where t is the 
    time in seconds. Write a program that prompts the user for a time less than 
    4.5 seconds and then displays the height of the object at that time.
