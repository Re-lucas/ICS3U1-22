    Assume that the following declarions and assignments have been made:
    int age = 16;
    int height = 175;
    int weight = 70;
    char sex = ‘M’;
    boolean healthy = true;
    Using these values, evaluate each expression.

    a) age >= 16 && healthy
    age >= 16 && healthy evaluates to 16 >= 16 && true which is true && true and finally true.

    b) !(weight <= 75) && height >= 180
    !(weight <= 75) && height >= 180 evaluates to !(70 <= 75) && 175 >= 180 which is !true && false then false && false and finally false.

    c) age > 10 || sex == ‘F’ && height < 170
    age > 10 || sex == ‘F’ && height < 170 evaluates to 16 > 10 || 'M' == 'F' && 175 < 170 which is true || false && false then true || false and finally true.

    d) !(height < 160) && ( weight < 60)
    !(height < 160) && ( weight < 60) evaluates to !(175 < 160) && (70 < 60) which is !false && false then true && false and finally false.
