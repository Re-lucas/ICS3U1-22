    Evaluate the following boolean expressions to true or false
    a) ! (9 < 3)
    This is a logical non-arithmetic operation. 
    First, it determines whether 9 is less than 3, which is false. 
    Then invert the result, so the whole expression is true.


    b) (5 > 6) || (!(true))
    First, determine if 5 is greater than 6, which is false.
     Then it takes a false value for true, which is also false. 
     Therefore, the entire expression is false.

    c) (“abc” != “ABC”) && (3 <=3)
    First, determine whether "abc" is not equal to "ABC," which is true. 
    Then we determine if 3 is less than or equal to 3, which is also true. 
    Therefore, the whole expression is true.

    d) !(!(!(8 = = 8)))
    First, determine whether 8 is equal to 8, which is true. 
    Then we invert the result, and then we invert it again, and then we invert it again, so the whole expression is true.
