    Consider the following statements
    if (age < minAge) {
    if (income > minIncome) {
    System.out.println(“Accept”);
    } else {
    System.out.println(“Reject”);
    }
    }

    What will the statement print if
    a) age > minAge and income < minIncome?
    If age > minAge and income < minIncome, the outer if condition age < minAge will evaluate to false, so the inner if statement will not be executed. Therefore, nothing will be printed.

    b) age < minAge and income < minIncome?
    If age < minAge and income < minIncome, both conditions age < minAge and income > minIncome will evaluate to true, so the inner if statement will be executed. It will print "Reject".

    c) age > minAge and income > minIncome?
    If age > minAge and income > minIncome, the outer if condition age < minAge will evaluate to false, so the inner if statement will not be executed. Therefore, nothing will be printed.

    d) age < minAge and income > minIncome?
    If age < minAge and income > minIncome, both conditions age < minAge and income > minIncome will evaluate to true, so the inner if statement will be executed. It will print "Accept".
