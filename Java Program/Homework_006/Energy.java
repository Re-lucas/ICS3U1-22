    Description:Einsteinâ€™s famous formula, e=mc2, gives the amount of energy 
    released by the complete conversion of matter of mass m into energy e. If m
    represents the mass in kilograms and c represents the speed of light in 
    meters per second (3.0 * 108 m/s), then the result is in the energy units 
    Joules. It takes 360000 Joules to light a 100-watt light bulb for an hour. 
    Create a program that prompts that user for a mass in kilograms and then 
    displays the energy and the number of light bulbs that could be powered.
